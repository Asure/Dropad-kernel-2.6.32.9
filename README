What is this
------------

A 2.6.32.9 GPL Licensed Kernel for the Dropad A8
This is not all my own work. Most of it comes from the MangoV210 project.

---------

Many things are working so far, but not everything is 100%:

- Ext4, UBI, MTD, CPU support etc.
- Boot up and into Android init. 
- ADB works
- Android starts, but doesn't like the missing ALSA (see below)

Todo/Not working:
-----------------

- ALSA WM8676 soc sound (stub driver is in place.)
- MTD mapping See note.. (workaround by adding 'mtdparts' to u-boot. Need to add to kernel build.)
- Buttons (cause kernel panic when you press power.)
- Proper recovery image instead of tar.gz parsing crap from urbetter..
- Overclock

Note:
setenv bootargs "mtdparts=s5pv210-nand:0x20000@0x80000(misc),0x800000@0x100000(recovery),0x600000@0x900000(kernel),0xEB00000@0x1500000(rootfs-combin),0x200000@0x1300000(param)"

Untested
--------
