What is this
------------

A 2.6.32.9 GPL Licensed Kernel for the Dropad A8
This is not all my own work. Most of it comes from the MangoV210 project.

Many things are working so far, but not everything is 100%:

- Ext4, UBI, MTD, CPU support etc.
- MTD mapping (needed for proper UBIfs functions), compatible with 01-03 firmwares and up only!
- Boot up and into Android init. 
- ADB works
- Android starts, but doesn't like the missing ALSA (see below)

Todo/Not working:
-----------------

- Need to add ALSA WM8676 soc sound for on-board soundcard. (stub driver is in place.)
- Need to add ALSA WM8580 soc sound (HDMI audio uses it.)
  (Allmost all the ALSA stuff is here: https://github.com/richardtrip/galaxytab_kernel)
- Need to port mma7660 orientation sensor
- Need to score source code for the touch screen (ft5x0x_ts)
- Need to grab ut7gm framebuffer lcd/backlight code from 2.6.29 
  (See here for 2.6.29 https://github.com/kboek/android-urbetter/tree/master/kernel/urbetter)
- Need to add GC0308 UVC video camera driver (appears to be connected to USB..)
- Overclock, once everything seems stable.
  (All the missing stuff is here: https://github.com/richardtrip/galaxytab_kernel)
- Find out what else is broken, once we boot into Android.

Old fix for mtd partitioning:
setenv bootargs "mtdparts=s5pv210-nand:0x20000@0x80000(misc),0x800000@0x100000(recovery),0x600000@0x900000(kernel),0xEB00000@0x1500000(rootfs-combin),0x200000@0x1300000(param)"
